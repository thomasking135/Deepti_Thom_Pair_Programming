        <h3>Thomas Responses</h3>

        <p id="bold">How did you sleep?</p>
        <p>"I slept reasonably well. I avoided binging on too much tele last night and I managed to go to bed at a good time."</p>
        <p id="bold">How do you feel now?</p>
        <p>"Excited but nervous also. I have seen the work produced by many of my peers and it has been amazing. I am often worried mine
            will not be up to the same standard."</p>
        <p id="bold">How comfortable do you feel with the code you are about to do?</p>
        <p>"I am quite confident with HTML, reasonably confortable with CSS and so very very afraid of JavaScript. But, I do like how these 
            languages can come together to make something unique and beautiful."</p>
        <p id="bold">Is there anything going on in your life that might affect how you are working at the moment?</p>
        <p>"I am caring for my elderly mother and uncle at the moment. This is a big responsibility for me but one that gives me a lot of joy. 
            They are two people I care deeply about."

        <p>"My friend's think I'm a bit of a prankster and I do love looking funny stuff on the net. I love communicating through memes.
            I find a funny meme can really perk up someone's day. Now that I'm entering the IT sector, here is one of my favourite ones.""
